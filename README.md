# Kanboard Jenkins plugin
A plugin that allows to create or update a Kanboard task as a post-build action, to trigger a build when a task is created or moved, and to fetch a task and its attachments as a build step.

This plugin requires that Kanboard be configured to use the "X-API-Auth" header for authentication as described in the documentation here: https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/api/authentication.html
